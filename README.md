# AI-Agents
Experimenting with implementing AI agents and exploring their potential applications using Langgraph.

# What are AI agents?
An AI agent is an entity that can act autonomously in an environment. It can take information from its surroundings, make decisions based on that data, and act to transform those circumstancesâ€”physical, digital, or mixed. More advanced systems can learn and update their behavior over time, constantly trying out new solutions to a problem until they achieve the goal.
These agents and their behaviour is defined by signal flow graph. To support directly building agents like this, langchain has extended to support langGraph.
